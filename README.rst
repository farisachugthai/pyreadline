pyreadline
==========

Introduction
============

Pyreadline is a package inspired by GNU readline which aims to improve the
command line editing experience. In most UNIX based pythons GNU readline is
available and used by python but on windows this is not the case. A readline
like python library can also be useful when implementing commandline like
interfaces in GUIs. The use of pyreadline for anything but the windows
console is still under development.

It is based on the UNC readline package by Gary Bishop which in turn is
based on the `ctypes` module in the standard library.

It is not complete. It has been tested for use with Windows 2000 and Windows XP
as well as Windows 10.

Version 2.0 runs on Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3+ using the same code.

Installation
=============

The pyreadline package is based on the readline package by Gary Bishop. It is
not a complete replacement for GNU readline. The pyreadline package is
currently only for the win32 platform. The pyreadline package tries to improve
the integration with the win32 platform by including such things as copy
paste.


Dependencies
------------

  * PyWin32, the win32 Python extensions from
    http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond.

  * This in turn requires Tomas Heller's ctypes from
    http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes.


Current release version
-----------------------

Get the installer for the current installer at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline/


Development version
-------------------

The development is hosted at https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline

The current trunk version can be cloned with git, :command:`git clone
https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline.git`.

Install with the usual :command:`python setup.py install` from the pyreadline
folder.


Features
========

*  Keybindings in accordance with the GNU readline library

*  :kbd:`Shift`-Arrow keys for text selection

*  :kbd:`Control-C` for copy

   * Activate with `allow_ctrl_c(True)` in config file. An example is given at
     :file:`pyreadline/configuration/pyreadlineconfig.ini`

*  Double tapping :kbd:`Control-C` will raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`

   * use `ctrl_c_tap_time_interval(x)` where x is your preferred tap time window

   * default 0.3s

*  standard `paste` which pastes first line of content on clipboard

*  Alternatively, users can set the option ``IPython_paste``

   * which pastes tab-separated data as list of lists or numpy array if all data is numeric

*  `paste_multiline_code` pastes code that spans multiple lines or has
   embedded newlines in it.

   * Useful for copy pasting code

The latest development version is always available at the GitHub `repository`_.
